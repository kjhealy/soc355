## What is this course about?

This upper-division undergraduate course is about modern organizations and theories about how to manage them. 

Our focus is on for-profit firms. However we will also look at other organizations (e.g., churches, the state, unions, voluntary associations, social movements, and so on) as we go. We will explore different explanations of how organizations work, why they fail, how experts have said they should be managed, and how they connect with other aspects of social structure and culture. We will also critically examine the origins and development of the theories we read.

The course will give you a grounding in the sociology of organizations and teach you how to put these ideas to work both when analyzing real organizations and when navigating the vast scholarly and popular literature about them.
